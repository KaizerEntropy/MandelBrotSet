# MandelBrotSet
This is a program, visualizing the Mandelbrot set, the numbers lying inside it. It has a brightness based gradient on how many iterations a number in the complex plane takes to diverge from the MandelBrot set. Colours can be changed, gradient can be made brighter or darker. The animaiton has been made with the SDL library, and programmed in C.
